This project uses the http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ ml-1m dataset to build a movie recommendation model using PySpark. The ml-1m dataset consists of 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies. It was released on 2/2003.\n\nThe movielens front end application where users can rate movies is available here: https://movielens.org/. <br/>\nA screenshot of the movielens user interface can be seen below.\n\nThis demo also has a basic web application you can try out.  The web application is available here: https://movie-recommend-demo.mybluemix.net\n\n\n"

This notebook we investigate how we can augment the batch generated model with ratings for new users so that we can provide recommendations without having to wait for the next batch run.\n\n#### Step 5 - Install Spark Cloudant \n\nIn this notebook we install the latest Spark Cloudant library to use Cloudant as a source of rating data and as a destination for the generated recommendations.<br>\n\n\n#### Step 6 - Cloudant Datastore Recommender\n\nIn this notebook we setup Cloudant as the source datastore for user's movie ratings.  We also use Cloudant as the target where we can save the generated recommenations.<br>\n\n#### Step 7 - Setup Movie Recommendation Web Application\n\nIn this notebook, we walk through setting up a web application where users can rate movies and receive recommendations using the Cloudant Datastore Recommnder.<br>\n\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have any questions about this project, please contact me at <chris.snow@uk.ibm.com>\n\n\n## Credits\n\n- Thanks to University of Minnesota for allowing the movielens data to be used for this demo.\n- This site was really useful https://github.com/jadianes/spark-movie-lens\n"
